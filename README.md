# Condor
A Processing pseudo-clone for Python which intends to improve on Processing.py.

## Why?
Processing is a fantastic improvement over Java syntax when it comes to any
sort of graphical programming environment. However, when simply porting its
behavior to Python syntax, I believe it degrades Python's simplicity. Python's
nice I/O is bogged down by the Processing I/O specification. I also want to
have Python 3 support and I want the freedom to easily use other editors.
